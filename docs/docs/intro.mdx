# Introduction

The Qdrant Kubernetes Operator automates the deployment and management of Qdrant
clusters on Kubernetes. The Operator has controllers that manages Custom
Resource Definitions (CRDs) to extend the Kubernetes API for Qdrant clusters.

## Features

  clusters on Kubernetes.

  clusters. Supported Custom Resources include `QdrantCluster`,
  `QdrantCollection`, `QdrantCollectionFieldIndex` to manage Qdrant resources.
- **Scaling**: The Operator can scale Qdrant clusters up or down.
- **Security**: API key support using either user-provided keys or
  auto-generated keys.
